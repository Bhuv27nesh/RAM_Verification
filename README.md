# RAM_Verification
A 1024x8 synchronous RAM was verified using directed tests with task-based stimulus for better code density. Line coverage reached 100%, but toggle coverage is ~50–57%, showing limited signal activity. One logic branch remains untested, and the address manipulation bug affects full memory access.
